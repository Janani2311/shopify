SHOPIFY - This is a simple e-commerce UI with a functionality of adding items to the cart by clicking "Add to cart" button.
        - And to remove items from the cart by clicking "Remove from cart" button. 
        - The cart count should be increased while clicking "Add to Cart" button and decreased while clicking "Remove from cart" button.

        - I have created multiple reusable components - Header, Navbar, Card, Footer.
        - Cards are created in a dynamic manner.
        - Achieved the functionality using HOOK concept UseState to rerender the components.






# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
